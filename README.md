# EDA_FIFA_Analysis_with_Python
Founded in 1904 to provide unity among national soccer associations, the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) boasts 209 members, rivaling that of the United Nations, and is arguably the most prestigious sports organization in the world.

In this project we will perform simple exploratory data analysis of the FIFA 19 data set. The data set can be found on Kaggle. FIFA is the Fédération Internationale de Football Association and FIFA 19 is part of the FIFA series of association football video games.

For this analysis we will be using the python pandas library, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib. The dataset contains 89 columns but we will limit our analysis to the following ten columns:

Name — Name of Player
Age — Age of Player
Nationality — Nationality of Player
Value — Current Market Value
Wage — Wage of Player
Preferred Foot — Preferred foot of player
Height — Height of Player
Weight — Weight of player
Position — Position on the pitch
Overall — Player’s Overall Rating
